# Project Overview: Continuous Deployment with AWS Services

This project builds upon the work done in this project, extending it to incorporate more AWS services for seamless deployment and testing.

### Features:

- **Beanstalk Environment Setup:** Create a Beanstalk environment along with an RDS instance to support the application's backend.
- **Network Configuration:** Configure security groups to allow traffic between the RDS database and the Beanstalk instance.
- **Initialization Queries:** SSH into the Beanstalk instance to execute initialization queries on the RDS database.
- **Pipeline Integration:**
  - Add a deployment stage to the pipeline for deploying the application onto Beanstalk.
  - Implement a testing stage using Selenium to ensure the functionality of the web application.
  - Store screenshots of the test results on S3 for further analysis and reference.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Beanstalk Environment and RDS Setup:**
   - Create a Beanstalk environment configured to host the web application.
   - Provision an RDS instance to serve as the backend database.
   - Configure security groups for both services to allow communication between them.

2. **Initialization Queries:**
   - Access the Beanstalk instance via SSH.
   - Execute initialization queries on the RDS database to set up necessary tables or data.

3. **Pipeline Integration:**
   - Extend the existing pipeline to incorporate deployment and testing stages.
   - Configure a deployment stage to automatically deploy changes to the Beanstalk environment upon successful builds.
   - Implement a testing stage using Selenium to automate web application testing.
   - Store screenshots of the test results in an S3 bucket for future reference and analysis.

### Usage:

- Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
- Ensure AWS CLI is properly configured with necessary credentials.
- Run the provided scripts or commands to execute deployment and testing stages.
- Refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on setting up and managing the project.
